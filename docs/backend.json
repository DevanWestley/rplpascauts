    "reasoning": "This Firestore structure prioritizes security and scalability for the Advocacy Alley application, focusing on authorization independence and clear access patterns. It leverages path-based ownership for user-related data and a segregated structure to simplify security rules.\n\n*   **Authorization Independence:** The structure avoids `get()` calls in security rules by denormalizing authorization data.  Petitions are stored under the `/users/{userId}/petitions/{petitionId}` path, making the `authorId` implicit in the path and accessible without needing a `get()` operation in the rules.\n\n*   **Structural Segregation:**  User data and Petition data are stored in separate collections, each with its own security profile.\n\n*   **Access Modeling:** Path-based ownership `/users/{userId}/petitions/{petitionId}` makes ownership clear and secure. Signatures are stored as subcollections of Petitions to clearly define their relationship.\n\n*   **QAPs (Rules are not Filters):** The structure facilitates secure `list` operations.  Listing petitions under a user's path `/users/{userId}/petitions` only requires checking the user's authentication. Public petitions could potentially be listed in a separate, dedicated collection if that feature is expanded. However, the current design focuses on user-created petitions.\n\nThe absence of a global roles collection (`/roles_admin/{uid}`) is intentional, as the initial requirements do not explicitly call for admin roles or any role other than 'user'. If the app evolves to include global admin roles, a dedicated collection as outlined in the design principles should be added.\n\nThis structure ensures that security rules are simple, robust, and easily debuggable, minimizing complexity and potential vulnerabilities."
